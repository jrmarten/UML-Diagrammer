:::::Possible Bugs:::::
Creating diagram:

When adding methods without type, throws significant number of exceptions, 
should generate an error message similar to when you enter in nothing.


Formatting from string to String in attributes and methods.


Null pointer exception if creating inheritance without a correct end pointer to a valid class.

Note: Creating new inheritance leaves extra pointer to be deleted by the user, otherwise it will result in null pointer exc.


Changing the access modifier to an invalid digit or symbol in a METHOD results in :
Class representation changed
Invalid name in Method Declaration
Can not rename
... but it still renames the METHOD in diagram, however it does not generate any code or representation.
Could it revert back to its old state? (I'll look into that).

Window of text box fails to re-size when text is enlarged, not a big issue, just a window re-size (will update).
