Creating diagram:

Cannot see the "SET START DECORATION" end of the line when you add any type of line decoration.
The end decoration works just fine, so look at the code and see why half of the arrow is hidden.  (11/08/2012 JAMESON)

When drawing a connection between two classes, if the line is drawn to an area outside of a class, it will break and throw exceptions
     //Should be fixed now a null pointer was thrown if notify all be a connection was not made ( at this point connection is null )
     //yet we where trying to remove the connection form the ends, which had not been connected.

When adding a role name, it gets added to one end of the line, not the middle
     //done intentionally use a : to separate two roles to be used at opposite ends.
     >>But isn't that where the multiplicity labels should go? Each line has only one role, so shouldn't that be in the middle?

Now the connection lines start in the middle of the class figure, instead of the edge, only if using the middle handle to draw the connection
